Exercise #2:
Using call-by-value evaluation and then lazy evaluation, write out the
first 10 steps of the evaluation of the following:

take 2 (makefrom 4 5)

Use the following definitions (clearly not OCaml syntax):

   take n [] = []
   take 0 (x::xs) = []
   take n (x::xs) = x::take (n-1) xs

   makefrom 0 v = []
   makefrom n v = v :: makefrom (n-1) (v+1)



Exercise #4:
Evaluate the first dozen steps or so of the following:

sum (take 3 (squares from 1))

where

   sum [] = 0
   sum x::xs -> x + sum xs

   squares from v = v*v :: squares from (v+1)
